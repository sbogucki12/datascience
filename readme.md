# What is this? 

For the most part, these are the notes I've taken while a student in the Cornell Machine Learning certificate course.  I only began recording my notes here about halfway through the course.  As of writing, I have one final lesson left (begins Aug 30, 2023).  

There are some other random files thrown in here (analysis on my running data, for example). 

# July 31

Completed lesson.  Learned how to code our own Support Vector Machines, how to match regularizers and loss functions, and how to add dimensionality to vectors utilizing the kernel trick.

Refactored some thoughts into a function that determines entropy for a root tree model that predicts whether an individual is likely to pay off a debt based on features: 
- Account balance
- Whether they rent or own their residence.
